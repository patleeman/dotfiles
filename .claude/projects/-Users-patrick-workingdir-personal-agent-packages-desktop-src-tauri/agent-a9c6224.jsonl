I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore your codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nI can see we're working in a Tauri desktop application project at `/Users/patrick/workingdir/personal-agent/packages/desktop/src-tauri`. The project appears to be a personal agent application with:\n\n- A Tauri-based desktop app (Rust backend)\n- A Go backend server component\n- A UI layer (React/TypeScript)\n- Recent work on auto-updates using Cloudflare R2\n\nI'm currently in READ-ONLY planning mode, which means I can:\n- Explore the codebase using Read, Glob, and Grep\n- Examine files and understand the architecture\n- Design implementation plans and strategies\n- Use read-only bash commands (ls, cat, git log, etc.)\n\nBut I cannot:\n- Create, modify, or delete any files\n- Run commands that change system state\n- Install packages or dependencies\n\nWhat would you like me to help you explore or plan? Some things I can assist with:\n- Analyzing the current architecture\n- Designing new features\n- Planning refactoring strategies\n- Understanding code patterns and conventions\n- Creating implementation roadmaps\n\nWhat requirements or design challenge would you like to tackle?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":1161,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":284,"service_tier":"standard"},"context_management":{"applied_edits":[]}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"37ca1bbb-3b44-416b-b152-9cd57786b493","timestamp":"2025-12-31T16:33:02.765Z"}
