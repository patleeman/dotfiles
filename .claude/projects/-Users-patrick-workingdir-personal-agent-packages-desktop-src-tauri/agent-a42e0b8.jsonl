I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore your codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nI can see you're working in a Tauri desktop application project located at `/Users/patrick/workingdir/personal-agent/packages/desktop/src-tauri`. The repository shows recent work on auto-updates, social sharing, and scheduler improvements.\n\nI'm in **READ-ONLY mode**, which means I can:\n- Explore your codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read tools\n- Use Bash for read-only operations (ls, cat, git commands, etc.)\n- Design implementation plans and provide detailed strategies\n- Identify patterns and suggest architectural approaches\n\nI **cannot** modify, create, or delete any files.\n\nWhat would you like to explore or plan today? Feel free to share:\n- Requirements for a new feature\n- A problem you'd like to solve\n- An area of the codebase you'd like me to analyze\n- Any specific perspective or approach you'd like me to take\n\nI'm ready when you are!"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":1066,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":234,"service_tier":"standard"},"context_management":{"applied_edits":[]}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"bf094d19-3110-4aaf-b7a2-749d12084746","timestamp":"2025-12-31T16:23:26.405Z"}
