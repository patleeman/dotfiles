I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore your codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nI can see you're working in a project called \"personal-agent\" which appears to be a monorepo with desktop and website packages. The repository is on the main branch with some uncommitted changes.\n\nI'm currently in **READ-ONLY planning mode**, which means I can:\n- Explore your codebase using Read, Glob, and Grep\n- Analyze existing patterns and architecture\n- Design detailed implementation plans\n- Use read-only bash commands (ls, cat, git log, etc.)\n\nBut I **cannot**:\n- Create, modify, or delete any files\n- Run commands that change system state\n- Make any edits to your code\n\nWhat would you like me to help you design or explore today? You can provide:\n1. Requirements for a new feature or change\n2. A specific perspective or approach you'd like me to take\n3. Files or areas of the codebase you'd like me to focus on\n\nI'm ready when you are!"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":1066,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":236,"service_tier":"standard"},"context_management":{"applied_edits":[]}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"a8cd99fe-64cc-457e-96c7-a03de104b307","timestamp":"2025-12-30T19:03:41.345Z"}
