I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore and plan for your codebase.\n\nI can see this is a desktop application built with Tauri (Rust backend) and what appears to be a React UI, with a Go backend component as well. The project seems to be an agent-based system with skills, logging, and various integrations.\n\nI'm in **READ-ONLY planning mode**, which means I can:\n- Explore your codebase using Read, Glob, and Grep\n- Use read-only Bash commands (ls, cat, git log, etc.)\n- Design implementation plans\n- Provide architectural guidance\n\nI **cannot**:\n- Create, modify, or delete files\n- Run installations or builds\n- Change system state\n\nWhat would you like me to help you plan or explore? Some examples:\n- Design a new feature implementation\n- Refactor existing code\n- Integrate a new capability\n- Improve architecture\n- Debug a complex issue\n\nPlease share your requirements, and I'll thoroughly explore the codebase to create a detailed implementation plan for you."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1725,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1725,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":241,"service_tier":"standard"},"context_management":{"applied_edits":[]}},"requestId":"req_011CWdfMecSoaq2HzdBr1dbC","type":"assistant","uuid":"60182e2b-be58-42e9-826c-039cad325609","timestamp":"2025-12-30T22:46:14.451Z"}
