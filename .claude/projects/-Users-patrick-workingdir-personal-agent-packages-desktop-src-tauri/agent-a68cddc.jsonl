I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore your codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nI can see I'm working in a Tauri desktop application project at `/Users/patrick/workingdir/personal-agent/packages/desktop/src-tauri`. The repository is on the `main` branch with a clean working directory, and recent commits show work on auto-updates, OG metadata, and social sharing features.\n\n**What I can do for you:**\n- Explore your codebase using Read, Glob, and Grep\n- Analyze architecture and patterns\n- Design implementation plans for new features\n- Identify critical files for implementation\n- Provide strategic guidance on code organization\n\n**Important: I'm in READ-ONLY mode**\n- I can only explore and plan - I cannot modify, create, or delete files\n- I cannot run commands that change system state\n- My role is to help you understand the codebase and design solutions\n\n**To get started, please provide:**\n1. Requirements or goals for what you'd like to implement\n2. (Optional) A specific perspective or approach you'd like me to take\n3. (Optional) Any specific files or areas of the codebase to focus on\n\nWhat would you like me to help you design today?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1024,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":281,"service_tier":"standard"},"context_management":{"applied_edits":[]}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"01507510-61b6-4d66-b0e2-2da5c4ebbdeb","timestamp":"2025-12-31T16:09:26.177Z"}
