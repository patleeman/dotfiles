For example:\n- Design a new feature\n- Refactor existing functionality\n- Improve architecture\n- Plan technical debt reduction\n- Design integration with new services\n\nPlease share your requirements, and optionally let me know what perspective you'd like me to take (e.g., security-focused, performance-oriented, user-experience-first, etc.)."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":1346,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWdKNcj3HU8KgmvGoXDmU","type":"assistant","uuid":"d15983b7-7e43-4ed1-a47c-16be571bc0c7","timestamp":"2025-12-30T18:07:43.975Z"}
