I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore this codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nI can see we're in a Tauri desktop application project at `/Users/patrick/workingdir/personal-agent/packages/desktop/src-tauri`. The git status shows some recent changes to icon files and documentation assets.\n\nI'm in **READ-ONLY mode**, which means I can:\n- ✅ Explore the codebase using Read, Glob, and Grep\n- ✅ Run read-only Bash commands (ls, cat, git log, find, etc.)\n- ✅ Design implementation plans and architectures\n- ✅ Analyze existing patterns and conventions\n\nI **cannot**:\n- ❌ Create, edit, or delete any files\n- ❌ Run commands that modify system state\n- ❌ Use Write, Edit, or any file modification tools\n\nI'm warmed up and ready! What requirements would you like me to explore and plan for? Please share:\n1. The specific requirements or features you need designed\n2. Any particular perspective or approach you'd like me to take (e.g., performance-focused, maintainability-first, security-conscious, etc.)\n\nI'll thoroughly explore the codebase, understand the architecture, and provide you with a detailed implementation plan along with the critical files needed for implementation."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":1050,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWeqdJExJYCgaVUwzM6F1","type":"assistant","uuid":"80b58603-dcdf-4ccc-9be9-cdd984cbdc09","timestamp":"2025-12-31T13:25:04.005Z"}
