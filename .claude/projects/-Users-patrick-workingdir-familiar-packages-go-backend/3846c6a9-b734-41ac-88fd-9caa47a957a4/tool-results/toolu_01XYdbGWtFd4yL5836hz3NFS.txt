# Claude Usage Limit Handling in Opencode

## Issue Summary

The GitHub issue #877 documents a feature request for better error messaging when Claude's usage limit is reached in Opencode.

## Current Behavior

**Problem:** "Opencode UI remains stuck at 'working...' with no error message displayed" when Claude usage limits are exceeded. Users must manually check Claude to diagnose the issue.

## Key Technical Details

The issue includes logs showing the service initialization sequence but lacks error handling specifics. Log entries show:
- Provider initialization for Anthropic
- Session creation and message handling
- No visible quota/rate limit error capture in standard logs

## Related Issues

Multiple duplicate issues indicate this is a persistent problem:
- Issue #2964: "Hangs without error message when Claude Code session limit is reached"
- Issue #3106: "Opencode Silent on Reaching Provider Quota"
- Issue #3525: "Quota Limit Exceeded Error is not handled properly"

## Requested Improvements

1. **Immediate error display** when rate limits or quota errors occur
2. **Usage statistics visualization** (referenced: ryoppippi/ccusage project)
3. **Time-to-reset information** displayed to users
4. **Optional auto-retry** after quota resets

## Implementation Status

As of November 2025, the issue was marked as duplicate of #777 and remains in discussion phase regarding optimal implementation approach.
