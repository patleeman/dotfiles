# Claude Max Integration in OpenCode

Based on the documentation provided, here's what I found about Claude authentication:

## Authentication Methods

OpenCode supports multiple ways to connect Claude:

1. **Claude Pro/Max Subscription**: "Once you've signed up, run the `/connect` command and select Anthropic. Here you can select the **Claude Pro/Max** option and it'll open your browser and ask you to authenticate." This browser-based OAuth approach allows subscription holders to authenticate directly.

2. **API Key Creation**: Users can alternatively "select **Create an API Key** if you don't have a Pro/Max subscription. It'll also open your browser and ask you to login to Anthropic and give you a code you can paste in your terminal."

3. **Manual Entry**: A third option lets users "select **Manually enter API Key** and paste it in your terminal."

## Key Details

- Credentials are stored in `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`
- After authentication, "all the Anthropic models should be available when you use the `/models` command"
- Base URLs can be customized via configuration for proxy services

## What's Not Covered

The documentation doesn't specify rate limits, subscription tier differences, or detailed OAuth token refresh mechanisms—these implementation details aren't included in this provider guide.
