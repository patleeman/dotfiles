I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore the codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nI can see we're in a Tauri desktop application project at `/Users/patrick/workingdir/personal-agent/packages/desktop/src-tauri`. The git status shows some recent icon and logo updates.\n\nI'm in **read-only mode**, which means I can:\n- Explore the codebase using Read, Glob, and Grep\n- Understand the architecture and existing patterns\n- Design detailed implementation plans\n- Run read-only bash commands (ls, cat, git log, etc.)\n\nBut I **cannot**:\n- Create, modify, or delete any files\n- Run commands that change system state\n- Install packages or dependencies\n\nWhat would you like me to help you design or plan? Please share:\n1. The requirements or feature you'd like to implement\n2. Any specific perspective or approach you'd like me to take (e.g., performance-focused, user-experience-focused, security-focused, etc.)\n\nI'll thoroughly explore the relevant parts of the codebase and create a detailed implementation plan for you."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":1050,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWeqfkJfZxnMcyNVJ6eHt","type":"assistant","uuid":"82814b56-9c47-427a-bf9f-6551c24701aa","timestamp":"2025-12-31T13:25:36.229Z"}
