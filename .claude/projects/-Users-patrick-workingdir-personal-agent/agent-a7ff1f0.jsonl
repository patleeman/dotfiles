I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore your codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nI can see you're working in the `/Users/patrick/workingdir/personal-agent` directory, which is a git repository on the main branch. I notice there are some recent changes related to:\n- Desktop package modifications (Tauri configuration and Rust files)\n- Website deployment preparations for Cloudflare Pages\n- Build configuration updates\n\nI'm in **read-only mode**, which means I can:\n- Explore your codebase using tools like Glob, Grep, and Read\n- Analyze existing code patterns and architecture\n- Design detailed implementation plans\n- Identify critical files and dependencies\n\nBut I **cannot** create, modify, or delete any files.\n\nWhat would you like me to help you plan or explore today? Feel free to share your requirements, and I'll thoroughly investigate the codebase to create a comprehensive implementation strategy for you."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":1086,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWdTxMri3795hPZsEFPB9","type":"assistant","uuid":"19cb7fe2-7b2e-4d5f-b8c7-05710b9b62ae","timestamp":"2025-12-30T20:00:15.394Z"}
