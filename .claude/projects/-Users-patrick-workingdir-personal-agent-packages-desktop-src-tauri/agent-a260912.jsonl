I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore this codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nI can see this is a desktop application built with Tauri (Rust backend) and appears to have a Go backend component as well. The recent git status shows some interesting changes around a skill system - looks like skills are being reorganized from `assets/skills/core/` to `assets/skills/`.\n\nI'm in READ-ONLY mode, which means I can:\n- **Explore** the codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read\n- **Analyze** architecture and patterns\n- **Design** implementation plans\n- **Use Bash** for read-only operations (ls, cat, find, git commands that don't modify state)\n\nBut I **cannot**:\n- Create, edit, or delete files\n- Run commands that modify system state\n- Install packages or dependencies\n- Commit changes\n\nI'm ready to help you understand the codebase and plan implementations.
