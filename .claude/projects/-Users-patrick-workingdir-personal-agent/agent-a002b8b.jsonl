I'm ready to help you explore the codebase and design implementation plans for Claude Code.\n\nI can see this is a personal agent project with:\n- A Go backend (`packages/go-backend/`)\n- A desktop UI built with React/TypeScript (`packages/desktop/ui/`)\n- Recent work on provider management and UI improvements\n- Integration with inference providers (OpenAI, and a new Gemini implementation)\n\nI'm in **READ-ONLY planning mode**, which means I can:\n- Explore the codebase using Read, Glob, Grep, and read-only Bash commands\n- Understand the architecture and existing patterns\n- Design detailed implementation plans\n- Identify critical files for future implementation\n\nI **cannot** modify, create, or delete any files.\n\nWhat would you like me to help you plan? I'm ready to:\n1. Explore specific parts of the codebase\n2. Understand how features work\n3. Design implementation approaches for new features\n4. Analyze architectural patterns\n5. Plan refactoring strategies\n\nJust share your requirements and any perspective you'd like me to take, and I'll dive in!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":1565,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWd9AbeYg4y61eRUJ1qtq","type":"assistant","uuid":"c15821cf-f092-4c8e-adda-edace570593e","timestamp":"2025-12-30T15:53:52.047Z"}
