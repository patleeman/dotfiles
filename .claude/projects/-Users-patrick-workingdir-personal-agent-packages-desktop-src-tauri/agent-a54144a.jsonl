I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore your codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nI can see we're in a Tauri desktop application project at `/Users/patrick/workingdir/personal-agent/packages/desktop/src-tauri`. The repository is on the `main` branch with some recent modifications to `tauri.conf.json` and a LogViewer component.\n\nI'm currently in READ-ONLY mode, which means I can:\n- Explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read commands\n- Examine files and understand architecture\n- Use bash for read-only operations (ls, cat, git log, etc.)\n- Design detailed implementation plans\n\nI CANNOT:\n- Create, modify, or delete any files\n- Make commits or stage changes\n- Install dependencies\n- Execute write operations of any kind\n\nWhat would you like me to help you with? Feel free to share:\n- Requirements you'd like me to explore\n- A specific feature or problem area to investigate\n- Any particular perspective or approach you'd like me to take\n\nI'm ready to dive into the codebase and help design a solid implementation plan!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":1033,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWewfM2PjSrdRRAJvsK6W","type":"assistant","uuid":"ab5561a9-b99e-4a0a-8499-4a032b40d28f","timestamp":"2025-12-31T14:44:11.659Z"}
