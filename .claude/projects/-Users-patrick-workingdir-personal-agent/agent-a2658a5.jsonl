I can:\n1. Explore specific parts of the codebase\n2. Understand current architecture and patterns\n3. Design implementation plans for new features\n4. Identify critical files for implementing changes\n5. Trace through code paths and dependencies\n\nJust provide me with your requirements and I'll get started!"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1524,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1524,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":257,"service_tier":"standard"},"context_management":{"applied_edits":[]}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"6b444622-e8fc-4f2e-b540-719d45af09cb","timestamp":"2025-12-30T14:09:54.841Z"}
