I'm ready to help you explore the codebase and design implementation plans for your Tauri desktop application.\n\nI can see this is a Tauri-based desktop app in the `/Users/patrick/workingdir/personal-agent/packages/desktop/src-tauri` directory. The recent commits show work on auto-updates with Cloudflare R2, social sharing metadata, and OG tags.\n\nTo get started effectively, I can:\n\n1. **Explore the codebase structure** - Understanding the Tauri configuration, Rust backend, and frontend integration\n2. **Review existing patterns** - Finding conventions for features, state management, and IPC communication\n3. **Analyze the architecture** - Understanding how components interact and where different types of logic live\n4. **Design implementation plans** - Creating detailed strategies for new features or improvements\n\nWhat would you like me to help you design or plan? For example:\n- Adding new features or functionality\n- Improving existing systems\n- Refactoring architecture\n- Integrating new dependencies\n- Planning UI/UX changes\n- Designing state management approaches\n\nPlease share your requirements, and I'll thoroughly explore the relevant parts of the codebase to create a detailed implementation plan for you."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1024,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":275,"service_tier":"standard"},"context_management":{"applied_edits":[]}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"56c21bb6-767c-492f-b528-9667b51b481c","timestamp":"2025-12-31T16:03:55.735Z"}
