I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore your codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nI can see you're working on a personal agent project with a desktop UI (React/TypeScript) and a Go backend. The recent commits show you've been:\n- Restoring core skills from git history\n- Increasing UI information density and improving backend provider management\n- Removing Python remnants and deprecated skills\n- Fixing duplicate message filtering issues\n\nI'm in **READ-ONLY mode**, which means I can:\n- Explore your codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read\n- Run read-only bash commands (ls, cat, git log, etc.)\n- Design detailed implementation plans\n- Identify critical files and patterns\n\nI **cannot** modify, create, or delete any files.\n\nWhat would you like me to help you with today? Do you have specific requirements or features you'd like me to explore and design an implementation plan for?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1330,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1330,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":210,"service_tier":"standard"},"context_management":{"applied_edits":[]}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"7dc4bb8b-13f2-4591-bef9-23c454a9cb56","timestamp":"2025-12-30T13:55:56.504Z"}
