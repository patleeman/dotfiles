I'm ready to help you explore the codebase and design implementation plans for Claude Code.\n\nI can see this is a personal agent project with:\n- A Go backend (`packages/go-backend`)\n- A desktop UI (`packages/desktop`) \n- Recent work on provider management, skills restoration, and UI improvements\n- Some uncommitted changes across both frontend and backend\n\nI'm in **READ-ONLY mode**, meaning I can:\n- ✅ Explore files with Read, Glob, and Grep\n- ✅ Understand architecture and patterns\n- ✅ Design implementation plans\n- ✅ Use bash for read-only operations (ls, git log, cat, etc.)\n\nBut I **cannot**:\n- ❌ Create, modify, or delete files\n- ❌ Run file-modifying commands\n- ❌ Install dependencies or change system state\n\nWhat would you like me to help you design or explore? I'm ready to:\n1. Analyze the codebase structure\n2. Understand existing patterns\n3. Design implementation approaches for new features\n4. Create detailed plans following your requirements\n\nJust provide me with your requirements and any perspective you'd like me to take, and I'll thoroughly explore and plan the solution!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":1620,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWdAs6Ji2UPBuFWk85pt1","type":"assistant","uuid":"29520ff2-4056-4757-9e17-f82e3d1d557c","timestamp":"2025-12-30T16:16:08.895Z"}
