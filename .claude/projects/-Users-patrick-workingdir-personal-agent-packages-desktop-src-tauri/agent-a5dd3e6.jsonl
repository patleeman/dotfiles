I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore and plan implementations in your codebase.\n\nI can see you're working in a Tauri desktop application project at `/Users/patrick/workingdir/personal-agent/packages/desktop/src-tauri`. The repository is clean with recent commits focused on social sharing metadata and page enhancements.\n\nI'm in **READ-ONLY planning mode**, which means I can:\n- Explore your codebase using tools like Glob, Grep, and Read\n- Execute read-only bash commands (ls, cat, git log, etc.)\n- Design implementation plans and architecture\n- Analyze existing patterns and conventions\n\nI **cannot** modify, create, or delete any files - my role is strictly exploration and planning.\n\nWhat would you like me to help you plan or explore today? Feel free to share:\n- Requirements for a new feature\n- A problem you'd like to solve\n- Code you'd like me to analyze\n- Architecture decisions you're considering\n\nI'm ready to dive in and create a detailed implementation plan for you!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1024,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWesxvouE76Z4L3s3C7Xw","type":"assistant","uuid":"1c13dd22-ac52-4bd0-8cd9-c0c64d39931c","timestamp":"2025-12-31T13:55:42.127Z"}
