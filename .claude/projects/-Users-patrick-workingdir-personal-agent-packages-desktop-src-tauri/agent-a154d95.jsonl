I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore your codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nI can see we're working in a Tauri desktop application project at `/Users/patrick/workingdir/personal-agent/packages/desktop/src-tauri`. The repository shows a recent modification to `useAutoUpdate.tsx` and recent commits related to social sharing metadata and page organization.\n\nI'm in **READ-ONLY mode**, which means I can:\n- Explore your codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read tools\n- Run read-only bash commands (ls, cat, git commands, etc.)\n- Design detailed implementation plans\n- Identify patterns and architecture\n\nI **cannot** and **will not**:\n- Create, modify, or delete any files\n- Run any commands that change system state\n- Use Write or Edit operations\n\nWhat would you like me to help you explore or plan today? I'm ready to:\n1. Understand your requirements\n2. Thoroughly explore the relevant parts of your codebase\n3. Design a solution approach\n4. Provide a detailed implementation plan with critical files identified\n\nPlease share your requirements and any specific perspective you'd like me to apply to the design process."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":1031,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWetS8LgptF8TY52U9b6M","type":"assistant","uuid":"13e7459c-453c-4a37-80e3-8e3006942b22","timestamp":"2025-12-31T14:01:52.362Z"}
