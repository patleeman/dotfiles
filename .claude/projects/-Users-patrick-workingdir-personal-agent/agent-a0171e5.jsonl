Please share:\n1. The feature or change you want to implement\n2. Any specific perspective or approach you'd like me to take during the design process\n3. Any initial files or context you'd like me to start with\n\nI'll thoroughly explore the codebase, understand the architecture, and provide you with a detailed implementation plan including the critical files needed for the work."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":1524,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":288,"service_tier":"standard"},"context_management":{"applied_edits":[]}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"e9cb8c0d-712c-44ca-bbf7-e664f9ecef5f","timestamp":"2025-12-30T14:59:26.716Z"}
