# Familiar

A local, high-performance AI agent desktop app built with Tauri, Go backend, and React UI.

## Tech Stack

- **Desktop**: Tauri (Rust) with React 19 + TypeScript frontend
- **Backend**: Go server (runs as Tauri sidecar)
- **UI**: Vite, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Query
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit), Playwright (e2e), Go test

## Essential Commands

All commands run via `make` from the project root:

```bash
# Setup & Run
make setup          # Install all dependencies
make run            # Start dev server (builds sidecar + runs tauri dev)
make build          # Production build

# Testing
make test           # Run all tests (backend + UI + e2e)
make test-backend   # Go tests only
make test-ui        # Vitest UI tests only
make test-e2e       # Playwright e2e tests

# Code Quality
make lint           # Go vet
make fmt            # Go fmt

# Other
make clean          # Remove build artifacts
make website-dev    # Run website dev server
```
