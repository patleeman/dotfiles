I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore your codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nI can see we're in a Tauri desktop application project at `/Users/patrick/workingdir/personal-agent/packages/desktop/src-tauri`. Based on the git status, there are several modified files across the project including:\n\n- README and documentation updates\n- Rust sidecar code (`src/sidecar.rs`)\n- Go backend components (scheduler, config, tools)\n- React UI components (CapabilitiesView)\n- Website documentation\n\nThe recent commits show work on Tauri auto-updates with Cloudflare R2, social sharing optimization, and various metadata enhancements.\n\nI'm ready to:\n1. Explore your codebase thoroughly using read-only operations\n2. Understand existing patterns and architecture\n3. Design implementation plans for any requirements you provide\n4. Identify the critical files needed for implementation\n\n**Important reminder**: I'm in read-only planning mode. I can explore files and design solutions, but I cannot create, modify, or delete any files.\n\nWhat would you like me to help you plan or explore?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":1161,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":260,"service_tier":"standard"},"context_management":{"applied_edits":[]}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"91b65e40-3a09-4d0b-b9ed-ebd219981a85","timestamp":"2025-12-31T16:35:01.385Z"}
