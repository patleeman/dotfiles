I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore your codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nI can see we're working in a personal-agent project with both desktop and website packages.

Could you share:\n\n1. **What feature or change are you planning to implement?** - What are the specific requirements or goals?\n\n2. **Any perspective or approach you'd like me to take?** - For example:\n   - Focus on performance optimization\n   - Prioritize maintainability\n   - Follow specific architectural patterns\n   - Consider security implications\n   - Ensure cross-platform compatibility\n\n3. **Any specific areas of the codebase I should focus on?** - Desktop app, website, shared packages, etc.\n\nOnce you provide these details, I'll thoroughly explore the relevant code, understand the current architecture, and design a detailed implementation plan for you.\n\nRemember: I'm here to explore and plan only - I won't be modifying any files, just helping you understand the codebase and design the best approach for your implementation."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":1066,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":260,"service_tier":"standard"},"context_management":{"applied_edits":[]}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"a3db5eb2-f699-4bd0-afe1-e2e55f0b29e4","timestamp":"2025-12-30T19:07:42.949Z"}
