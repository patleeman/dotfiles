I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore codebases and design implementation plans.\n\nI can see you're working in a Tauri desktop application project at `/Users/patrick/workingdir/personal-agent/packages/desktop/src-tauri`. I notice there are some uncommitted changes in the Go backend related to the scheduler.\n\nI'm operating in **READ-ONLY mode**, which means I can:\n- Explore your codebase using tools like Glob, Grep, and Read\n- Analyze architecture and patterns\n- Design implementation plans\n- Use bash for read-only operations (ls, cat, git log, etc.)\n\nBut I **cannot**:\n- Create, modify, or delete files\n- Run commands that change system state\n- Install dependencies or make commits\n\nWhat would you like me to help you explore or plan today? You can provide:\n- Requirements for a new feature\n- A problem you'd like me to analyze\n- An architectural question\n- A perspective or approach you'd like me to take\n\nI'm ready to dive into your codebase!"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1066,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1066,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":240,"service_tier":"standard"},"context_management":{"applied_edits":[]}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"cabd6683-3ce3-458f-add2-7f3a2beab9cc","timestamp":"2025-12-31T16:21:29.000Z"}
